Please create a small project in Kotlin that contains a function that takes an input string like "one-two-seven-four-nine-zero" 
and returns a string with the format "1+2+7+4+9+0=23".
Then test the function with some possible inputs (but please not use the input from this description), 
you can do this directly in the main function. It should be possible to pass the digits 0-9. 
Everything that is not specified you can solve as you like it or as you think it makes sense
